UIM ARCHIMEDES RELEASE NOTES                  08.12.89 MATTHEW ATKINSON
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following notes are required reading.

 1. The default setting is for high dampening when executing rolls, 
    climbing or diving. For those who want more of a challenge then 
    NUM LOCK will toggle between high and low dampening.

 2. The mouse sensitivity is controlled by pressing HOME. This can 
    only be done when in the ocean AND viewing your surroundings.
    The sensitivity will be displayed from 0-7, the latter being the 
    most sensitive. It is incremented once per second while pressing 
    the key. 
    The recommended setting of the mouse speed using !Configure from 
    desktop is in the middle. It is no substitute for a good mouse
    mat!!!.

 3. The Voltmace joystick may be used as a direct replacement for the 
    mouse. The sensitivity is adjusted according to the manufacturers 
    instructions.  
    Selecting J for joystick will aid the use of the device although it 
    will work when the mouse option is selected.

 4. Sound. As described in the manual the keys Q and S will turn the 
    sound off and on. For more refined volume control use keys PAGE UP 
    and PAGE DOWN, the former increasing the volume.

 5. Generators. As you equip your submarine with more powerful 
    generators then the colour of your beams will change. The colours 
    are, from weak to strong.

    Red-Yellow-Green-Cyan-White

    Your opponents also have different powers so you can judge their 
    strength when they attack.
