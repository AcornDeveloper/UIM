<h2><center>Playing the game </center></h2>

<p>After loading the game you are presented with the initial start position. If you already have a saved position proceed to the disc menu and load it. </p>

<p>You are now in a port and can trade and equip your submarine at will here. When you are satisfied that you wish to leave the port then go to the network map by pressing <b>F1</b> . Now select a suitable port which you would like to go to. Press <b>F5 </b> and your submarine will be launched into the ocean. If you now press <b>H </b> then orbital flight will be undertaken. </p>

<p>You will now re-enter the earth's atmosphere. If you have a re-entry module fitted to your central computer then this is the time to activate it. If you are not fitted with a re-entry module then follow these instructions. Steadily follow the re-entry curve on your instrument panel by keeping the cross hairs central on the re-entry indicator. See the Instrument panel for its position. The further you deviate away from the curve the more your heat shield bums up, too much and you will burn up too. When you reach the glide path, automatic control takes over and brings you into a splash land. </p>

<p>In the middle of the instrument panel is your sonar display. It shows the position of other submarines, replicants, torpedoes etc.. </p>

<p>Your port's entrance is shown by a marker buoy. Proceed to the centre of the buoy and you will automatically be docked. The marker buoy does not appear on the sonar display. The "re-entry indicator" now becomes the "marker buoy indicator". To find the marker buoy you must make the cross hairs central. If they are central but you cannot see the buoy then it will be immediately behind you. About turn skipper! It is not possible to destroy the marker buoy with your generator. </p>

<p>Initially it is essential that you learn how to make money by trading in commodities. Read the chapter on it carefully (Chapter 10). The first piece of equipment to buy (but not for some time) is arguably the cargo pod - it doubles the quantity of commodities you can carry. Plus check out <b>Process Control</b>  (Chapter 9) - there's money to be made there too. </p>

<h4>Missions </h4>

<p>When you have a mission module up and running on your central computer, selecting a mission by pressing<b> Shift-F9</b>  prints out the mission to be undertaken. </p>

<p>You are told where to go to receive your orders. When you get there you are given further details. Certain missions require that you are carrying certain items of equipment when you reach the target port. This sometimes makes the mission a lot harder as you may have to buy the items especially in order to complete it. </p>

<p>There is one mission to perform in each of the 256 networks. The missions are of the fetch and carry variety, e.g. take some badly needed drugs or deliver some documents. </p>

<p>It is a condition of proceeding to the next network that you complete the mission in hand. You will of course be rewarded for completion of each mission although there are several in which completing it is its own reward. </p>

<p>The rewards range from items of special equipment not normally available at ports, to straight forward cash. You are then taken to the next network. Those rewards which are items of equipment can be listed by <b>Shift-F5.</b>  Most of the equipment is self explanatory in name and action. They will always be of beneficial value to you and your submarine. </p>

<p>A mission's progress is saved with your position so it is not necessary to complete the mission in hand in one sitting. </p>
