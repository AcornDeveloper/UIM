<p>This is a way of earning money by your ability to take raw materials and produce other products with an enhanced value. This can only be used when in a port and only <b>once </b> per visit to a port. You must have sufficent money to rent the apparatus and buy the raw materials. You then have a limited time in which to manipulate the valves and controls to produce the optimum efficiency. Due to the nature of the equipment the valves must be constantly adjusted due to vibration so as to keep the output up. </p>

<p>To select a valve use the number keys <b>1 to 8, </b> then use <b>Cursor Up</b>  to open the valve and <b>Cursor Down</b>  to close it.</p>

<p>During your use of the equipment you have visual indicators of your time, efficiency and money earned. To operate a valve press the required number and, keeping it pressed, adjust it as required.</p>

<ol>
<li> <b>Basalt processor</b>
<ul>
<li> Rent -125 N$. <br>
<li> <b>Raw material</b>  - Basalt<br>
<li> <b>Products </b> - Water, Hydrogen and Oxygen <br>
</ul>
<p>Basalt is one of the most common forms of rock on the earth. The rock is crushed, the particle size being controlled, and then sent to an evaporator. There you control the temperature and a water bleed off valve. Any water not bled off goes to an electrolyses in which you control the current. The resulting gases of Hydrogen and Oxygen are collected for use in fuel cells. 

<p><li><b>Hydrocarbon processor</b>
<ul>
<li> <b>Rent </b> - 265 N$.<br>
<li> <b>Raw material</b>  - carbonaceous rock <br>
<li> <b>Products </b> - Hydrocarbons, Hydrogen and Carbon <br>
</ul>
<p>Hydrocarbons such as oil are rarely found in deposits where direct extraction by drilling is pessible. The most common form in which they are found is in carbonaceous rock, that is rock impregnated with hydrocarbons. </p>

<p>The rock is crushed, the particle size being controlled, and then sent to an extractor. Here the particles are heated until the hydrocarbons run off. The destination of the melted hydrocarbons is controlled. </p>

<p>They can either go straight as finished product or into a cracker which breaks them down into Hydrogen and Carbon. The cracker has a temperature control and a valve to expose the hydrocarbons to a catalyst.</p>

<p><li> <b>Steel production</b>
<ul>
<li> <b>Rent </b> - 550 N$.<br>
<li><b> Raw material</b>  - Iron ore<br>
<li> <b>Product </b> - Steel <br>
</ul>
Steel production involves taking iron ore, crushing the rock which you control the particle size of. Then the particles are fed into an neutron/magnetic separator which you control the current to. The separated particles are then sent to a continuous furnace and combined with a controlled flow of Carbon and Hydrogen. The resulting steel is then cast into ingots for sale. 

<p><li><b> Igneous rock</b>
<ul>
<li> <b>Rent </b> - 250 N$.<br>
<li> <b>Raw material</b>  - Igneous rock<br>
<li> <b>Products </b> - Carbon, Nitrogen, Sulphur and Uranium <br>
</ul>
Igneous rock is the most common form of rock in the earth and contains many useful products. It was sometime before an economical process was found to process it. The igneous rock is first crushed to a particle size which you control and then fed into a separator. The separator is the clever piece of technology as this produces Carbon, Nitrogen and Sulphur, all important products. <br>

It also separates out quantities of Uranium. This is fed into a gasifier and finally into a centrifuge where the Uranium 238 is separated from the useless Uranium 235. These two items must be controlled most carefully as the process is very fine. Gasifiers and centrifuges are used in preference to laser separation technology as this produces too high a grade Uranium for normal domestic use. 

<p><li> <b>Power generation</b>
<ul>
<li> <b>Rent </b> - 1000 N$.<br>
<li> <b>Raw materials</b>  - Hydrogen, Oxygen and Uranium<br>
<li> <b>Products </b> - Electrical power and Water <br>
</ul>
Electrical energy is the most flexible form of power used throughout the earth. Fission technology is used in preference to the burning of fossil fuels, there are far better things to do with them than simply burning them! Fusion technology is not allowed to be used in the private sector due to a series of unfortunate accidents arising out of profits taking precedent over safety.<br>

Hydrogen and Oxygen are combined in a fuel cell to produce electricity to run the equipment. The fission reactor controls are moderator rods to control the neutron flow in the pile and the pressure of the coolant circulating in the reactor. The coolant is fed into a heat exchanger at a user determined rate and the resulting steam is fed into turbines at a controllable rate. 

<p><li><b> Food production</b>
<ul>
<li> <b>Rent </b> - 375 N$.<br>
<li> <b>Raw materials</b>  - Amino acids, Hydrocarbons, Water and Nitrogen<br>
<li> <b>Products </b> - Carbon, Carbohydrates and Proteins <br>
</ul>
Amino acids, hydrocarbons, water and Nitrogen are combined in controllable quantities in a synthesizer in which the pressure, temperature and catalyst rods are controlled to produce the outputs of Carbon, carbohydrates and proteins. The synthesizer is a vital component in quite a few system economies.

<p><li> <b>Amino acid synthesis</b>
<ul>
<li> <b>Rent </b> - 500 N$.<br>
<li> <b>Raw materials</b>  - Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen<br>
<li> <b>Products </b> - Amino acids and Water <br>
</ul>
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins essential for the sustenance of life. The four inputs of amino acids, hydrocarbons, water and Nitrogen are sent in controllable quantities to an organic synthesizer. <br>

In the synthesizer they are subjected to varying amounts of pressure, temperature and catalyst rods. This produces the outputs of amino acids and water. This process is a vital link in the higher food production process. 

<p><li> <b>Silicon production</b>
<ul>
<li> <b>Rent </b> - 900 N$.<br>
<li> <b>Raw materia</b> l - Silicon dioxide<br>
<li> <b>Products </b> - Silicon crystals, Silicon wafers and Water<br>
</ul>
Silicon based electronic components are still the most common form of electronics used. More esoteric components manufactured from biological and or laser/crystals are used but for ease of use and economy Silicon wins everytime. <br>

The Silicon Dioxide (sand) is fed through a purifier to remove impurities such as Iron Oxide being the most common. Water is also driven off by a temperature control. This purification is most important as any trace of impurity will render the Silicon useless. The pure Silicon is fed into a crystal growing furnace the temperature and pressure of which are controlled to produce perfect crystals of a regular size and shape. <br>

These can be directly outputed for processing by other parties. However in the last section you can control the cutting of the Silicon into wafers for use in the integrated circuit manufacture. You must control the thickness of the wafers to gain an economical yield.
