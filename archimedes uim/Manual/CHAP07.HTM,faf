<h4>Description </h4>

<p>Trading can rake place on any of the ports visited. It is split into three menus: commodities, shares and currency. The last two require that you possess a portfolio hexagon in order that you may carry your holdings from one port to another. Simply highlight the item you wish to purchase (or sell), press the required key and input the information. There is sometimes a transaction charge on trading, typically being around 2% of the deal. </p>

<p><b>N.B.</b>  The maximum number of Network dollars you are allowed to hold is just over 65,000. If you sell either commodities, shares or currencies, the value of which would take you over 65,000N$, then the amount over this amount will be automatically confiscated! </p>

<p>You can quickly check what cargo you have on board by pressing Shift-F3. </p>

<a name="L0017"></a>
<h4>Commodites </h4>

<p>One of the areas of trading is in biological materials. There is always a demand for these special concentrates overcoming previous problems of profit margins before the concentration method was developed. The prices of these vary from port to port and are strongly linked to the various "operating indices" of each port. The actual variance of the prices is not great and therefore the arc of profitable trading will need to be "earnt". </p>

<p>lt is strongly advised that you initially record the prices of commodities at each port that you visit. Also note down each port's coordinates and operating index. </p>

<p>The quantities that can be traded in are given in tonnes. Your initial cargo capacity of commodities is 32 tonnes. You may carry up to 8 tonnes each of four different commodities. lf you have a cargo pod fitted your cargo capacity is increased to 64 tonnes and you may then carry up to 16 tonnes each of four different commodities. </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Salts </b> - Various salts are always required. The margins on these items are not great but are not liable to fluctuations others are prone to. <br>
<li> <b>Lipids </b> - Lipids or fats are highly valued on some ports as a delicacy. Generally however they are low value and not to be traded in by any but the sharpest of traders. <br>
<li> <b>Vitamins </b> - High value products needed for the health of all. When in demand expect good margins on these. Demand seems to be more in phase with fashion than dietary requirements. <br>
<li> <b>Hormones </b> - Again, high value products with excellent transport and storage properties. Not to be traded in lightly as some hormones are illegal due to their psycho-active properties. <br>
<li> <b>Hydrocarbons </b> - Hydrocarbons, although not strictly biological materials, are included here because they can be used as the starting point in third party manufacturing of biological materials. <br>
<li> <b>Proteins </b> - High demand product often over used because of ignorance of dietary requirements but who cares with the profits you can make on them? <br>
<li> <b>Amino acids</b>  - Building blocks of proteins. Used in third party manufacturing enterprises. Care must be excercised here as some amino acids are useless and some downright toxic. <br>
<li> <b>Carbohydrates </b> - Your general foodstuffs. Correct handling and loading procedures must be followed to prevent contamination with the asarit, a voracious insect form created by a rogue genetic engineer. <br>
<li> <b>Cellulose </b> - Cellulose sheets are valued highly as low cost building materials. <br>
<li> <b>Keratins </b> - These are the products of insects and as such have a limited value. <br>
<li> <b>Nitro-amines</b>  - Chemically similar to amino acids but not the desired value. Trading is limited bur. the entrepreneur can always find a market. <br>
<li> <b>Salycyclic acid</b>  - Salycyclic acid or aspirin is the most common drug used. Despite centuries of drug research an effective alternative has yet failed to be found. Cheap but always in demand. <br>
<li> <b>Fatty acids</b>  - Breakdowm products of lipids so value not good. Recent research has been using these as start products for as yet classified produccs. The moral being here if you think it's destined for some value enhancement then haggle for a better price. <br>
<li> <b>Endorphins </b> - Risky substances. Endorphins cover a wide variety of drugs much prized on some ports and despised on others. They are the equivalents of opiates. Unless you are sure what you are doing then avoid them at all costs. <br>
<li> <b>Genetic material</b>  - This is dangerous material. Genetic material wrongly used can lay waste entire biological systems. Therefore only trade with authorized dealers or have your conscience severely examined. <br>
<li> <b>Alcohols </b> - Ready market in all areas of society for the right type of alcohol. Used for everything from medicine to a beverage. Chemical research recently produced an alcohol with five times the enebriation factor of common ethyl alcohol. Consume with care. <br>

<h4>Shares</h4>

<p>No trading can take place in this market until you have obtained a portfolio hexagon. The dealing in the network stock and shares market can bring <i>great rewards</i>  and <i>great misery. </i> </p>

<p>Share prices when you enter a port are stable and vary only slightly how ever long you stay. The real money is to be made from trading with other ports. </p>

<p>You can carry up to 4 different types of share. The maximum you can hold of any particular share is 255. </p>

<p>The Stock Regulation Bawd governs what companies shall be listed and issues guidelines according to the type of company. Each company is put into one of five categories from which you can tell at a glance what type each share is. The five categories are as follows. Then follows the shares thernselves.
 </p>
<ol>
<li> <b>Trust </b> - These are companies which have a diverse investment in the exchange. They manage large funds and as such they are generally solid performers for your investment. 
<li> <b>Inc </b> - A certificate of incorporation is the first step a number of companies take before moving onto corporation status. Think of it as a testing phase before they are trusted enough. Diverse operations are their keywords. 
<li> <b>Unl </b> - This means the company is unlisted on the exchange. This usually means that it: is a new company and as such requires a period of time before it can be acceptable. This is the company that is a good performer but equally likely to lose your investment overnight. 
<li> <b>Corp </b> - A corporation, in the network sense, is an assortment of companies usually too small to have a listing on the exchange. With a corporation the raising of finance and other related services is much easier. These were established so chat the NLC's would not have it all there own way. 
<li> <b>Nlc </b> - These letters stand for Network Limited Compamy and is given to only a few who are truly large. 'They are very diverse, in everything from manufacturing to financial services. They are like the proverbial octopus, a tentacle everywhere. Current legislation is expected to curb the power of these companies but expect a lot of political fallout in the mean time. 
</ol>

<ul>
<li> <b>Antares trust</b>  - A solid performer. Not liable to spectacular growth but for the more cautious and small investor this company will perform well. Recent news places Antares to the fore with the appointment of a new management team with impeccable credentials. <br>
<li> <b>Polymers Inc</b>  - A manufacturing company of all known types of polymers. Has a good record and an excellent research and development program which keeps it ahead of the competition. Recent speculation about it wanting to diversify may be proved true very soon. <br>
<li> <b>Terraform Unl</b>  - A leading edge technology company (and as such could be easily sacrificed on it) they literally terraform whole landscapes to make them habitable. Massive debts due to capital expenditure and very few customers make this a risky business. The potential returns are very high for the right kind of investor. <br>
<li> <b>Jovian Unl</b>  - Jovian is a new company specialising in financial services and as such is an unlisted one. Set up by some financial whizz-kids with sound backing it has proved a rising star on the market, they don't seem to be able to put a foot wrong. Many people are just waiting for them to do just that. <br>
<li> <b>Tachyon Trust</b>  - Many diverse investments make this a sound investment. It has been hit recently by the Falling Terran credit but some restructuring has all but cured this. Expect some good results in the next interim report. <br>
<li> <b>Satsuma Un</b> l - A new start up company founded on considerable venture capital. This company is developing new food production processes. No product as yet has been released but inside information if true makes this one of the companies of tommorrow. <br>
<li> <b>Cyberoid Corp</b>  - Cyberoid corporation manufactures remote control prostheses or robots to the uninitiated. These are used in every area of life from domestic servants to those jobs just too dangerous for intelligent life to do. Had a recent setback when the model 78S series machine was given an intelligence port based on biological materials which technically made it a sentient being. This came to light when a model 78S tried to commit suicide. <br>
<li> <b>Succinct Unl</b>  - A company on the verge of a listing on the exchange. Dealing in foodstuffs and transportation are their comer stones. Future transportation costs are liable to drop if new drive technology delivers the goals so watch out. For the smart investor and those who wish to build a wide portfolio. <br>
<li> <b>Bio-Med Corp </b> - A wide range of companies dealing in all aspects of bio-medical products and services. In its portfolio are several companies with exciting products promised. The medical area is currently one of strong growth. <br>
<li> <b>Chromaglu Nlc</b>  - The network's largest company intially founded on the fortunes of genetic engineering but quickly mushroomed under the guiding hand of its late managing director. Recent events have proved that some divisions of Chromaglu have been anything but the caring business it projects itself as. Good investment for the less principled investor. <br>
<li> <b>Zeta Bank GLC</b>  - The established banking and financial services company. Over-exposure to developing ports is the big question mark on this company. However a new flotation was over subscribed making confidence in it the highest for some years now. Expect long term investments to be better than short term. <br>
<li> <b>Interon Inc</b>   - A very low profile set of companies producing excellent products based on established robotic manufacturing technology. Very diverse product range. A solid performer for the first time investor. <br>
<li> <b>Norca Unl</b>  - Principally a manufacturer of computer ports and software. Has in the past produced excellent products based on existing technology. Rumours abound about a possible competition beating computer with a processing capabilty in the region of 16 Gi. They also are a manufacturer of weapons but nothing spectacular so far produced. <br>
<b>Note</b> . Gi means Gigainference or 1E9 logical inferences per second.

<li> <b>Equalan GLC</b>  - This company has an impeccable record of product development and marketing. Also very notable for its charitable contributions and works. A first class company in every sense of the word. <br>
<li> <b>Vizoid GLC</b>  - A company primarily in the media field. Is involved in all aspects of news gathering, holographic publishing, education and advertising. This is an advanced company which has proved a reliable index of the state of the network economy. <br>
<li> <b>Borealus Unl</b>  - Fair to middling is how you would describe Borealus. It has still not performed to the high expectations it generated when first launched. It deals in real estate presently in the doldrums. <br>
</ul>

<h4>Currency </h4>

<p>No trading can cake place in this market until you have obtained a portfolio hexagon.</p>

<p>The currency exchange is a very volatile place in which to make money. The rates vary at the slightest piece of news so a cool head and nerves of titanium are required. </p>

<p>All trading is done against the network standard of the network dollar (N$) in which all transactions are conducted. </p>

<p>You can carry up to four other different types of currency. The maximum number of units of each currency you can hold is 255. </p>

<p>Definitely for professionals only! </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Conchella </b> - A developing port's currency as used in preference to the network dollar. <br>
<li> <b>Paaseque </b> - Often overlooked because it's more of a long term investor's currency. Good  stabilty and acceptability in many ports. <br>
<li> b- Due to political difficulties trading in the shillop is restricted and is rumoured that it will be removed from the exchange in the near future. Has performed well in the past and if these problems can be sorted out then it will do so again.<br>
<li><b> Dia-Mona</b>  - An ultra hard currency backed by many sound port economics. Margins are tight but many a killing has been made with this currency. For the professionals only. <br>
<li> <b>Philfie Luker</b>  - Solid currency preferred by quite a few ports. Future fluctuations are forecast so this is where to make a fast dollar on the upward cycle. <br>
<li> <b>Rubicon </b> - A very old currency. Previously the network standard but now in steady decline. Had a recent revival after one NLC in a protest with the exchange would only deal in this currency. Notes are issued on hologramatic aluminium sheets. <br>
<li> <b>Antrition </b> - A minor currency favoured by only a few. Several sytems recently switched away from antrition in favour of the peaseque. The timing of the move was carefully done leaving several dealers with practically worthless holdings. <br>
<li> <b>Beageraff </b> - A reasonable performer for the right trader. It is still talked about when due to a computer error the notes issued were more valuable than the amounts they represented. This was due to the note being made of a rare earth metal instead of aluminium. Only recorded currency where the means of issue were more valuable than the actual value on the note. Eagerly sought after by collectors. <br>
<li> <b>Xerkerat </b> - A hard currency backed by several wealthy ports. A recent fall was due to false allegations of counterfeiting flooding the market with nearly perfect notes. <br>
<li> <b>Aggrrageld </b> - This currency is unique in the fact it has never been issued on notes or coins, it only exits as electrons inside computers. This was a concerted attempt to wean intelligent beings off cash to a cashless way of life. However so called intelligent beings seem to prefer handling cash so has not performed well. <br>
<li> <b>Herrac </b> - This currency seems unaffected by violent swings in the exchange and can usually be relied upon to hold its value. One point of interest is that to prevent counterfeiting the notes contain sequences of D.N.A. which must match the serial numbers on them. <br>
<li> <b>Mon -Her-Pog</b>  - Recent heavy trading on this currency has devalued it considerably. However it looks set for a bounce back in the near future. Inflation on a number of ports dealing in this could affect its price. <br>
<li> <b>Frappatal </b> - Hyper inflation hit a number of ports a few years back devaluing the frappatal many fold. Sound fiscal policy has restored confidence into this once ailing currency. Its past is now firmly behind and looks good for the future. <br>
<li> <b>Quince-Ar</b>  - A hard currency of the first order. Recently it was very fashionable to own this as it was issued as hologramatic tablets which were very eye catching. Bad results with people who were slightly susceptible to the pschyo-hypnotic effects meant they were withdrawn very quickly. Only recorded currency where it was fashionable to own rather than its trading value. <br>
<li> <b>Yip </b> - This currency has recently found Favour with organised crime elements due to the deregulation on controls. Also found favour with currency dealers for the same reason. <br>
<li> <b>Uurat </b> - A newcomer to the currency market so it has not got much of a history. Therefore it is to be traded in with caution. Recent speculation has it that this is the one to watch for the future. <br>

<h4>Financial module </h4>

<p>Upon purchasing a financial module to run on your central computer a number of facilities become available to help in your trading of shares and currency. </p>

<p>This Facility is within the <b>Shares and Currency</b>  facility. For instance simply highlight a currency then press F. You will now be given the performance of that particular currency over the last eight time periods. This information is displayed as a line graph for your ease of use.</p>

<p>Also displayed is the <b>Network Index</b>  which is a guide to the overall performance of the marker. This gives an indication of whether the market is in expansion or recession. You will find that the market behaves in a cyclical Fashion of boom and bust. The time period of a cycle is hard to measure and varies considerably. Your intuition is a far better tool than any software program.</p>

<p>You will note that commodities are not as volatile as the other two, so commodity prices really only vary according to the operating index which each port has. </p>

<p>The financial module has no predictive capabilities, indeed prediction is beyond most computers because of the sheer size of the market, amount of data etc... </p>
