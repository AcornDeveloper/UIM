<p>A measure of the technological/software capabilities of the port. This is rated on a scale of A to P with the latter being the most advanced. Added to this is a numeric scale of 0 to 7 which sub-divides the advancement scale up into 128 separate levels (A0 to P7). </p>

<h4>Submarine status</h4>

<p>This is accessed using <b>Shift-F3</b> </p>

<p>This displays a page of information concerning the current status of your submarine as described as follows. </p>

</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Credit</font></b> </p>

<p>The amount of cash you have in your personal account in Network Dollars (N$). You do not. carry cash around with you but have an account whose details are accessible to all ports. The maximum amount of Network Dollars you are allowed to have is just over 65,000. No one is allowed to become "too" wealthy or complacent:- ridiculous differences in wealth between individuals are no longer tolerated. </p>

<p>The reasons for this are by no means totally altruistic. It is essential that all submariners feel the need to trade - trade, as always, being essential to the world economy. In addition, it is also essential that all submariners participate in destroying the replicants (for which small bounties are given). Replicants appear from Network 4 onwards. </p>
