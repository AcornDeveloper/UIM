<h4>Submarines </h4>

<p>On your travels you will encounter many different submarine types throughout the 256 networks of the world's oceans. Many of the most advanced submarines are nor. present in the earlier networks.</p>

<p>The convention of nomenclature is one based on the species of Lepodoptera or butterflies. The advantages are two-fold, firstly the number of species is very large and secondly the classification has no social, political or military overtones.</p>

<p>The submarines range from "rust buckets" to the latest C.A.D. designed fighters and differ accordingly in performance, armaments etc... Each submarine is rated according to your submarine - a <i>Satyrus Accaea</i>  (Black Satyr). </p>

<p>There are 3 types of military and 1 type of police submarines. If you fire at and hit one of them, the message <b>"MILITARY"</b>  or <b>"POLICE"</b>  will briefly appear on the screen. When this occurs some sort of evasive action will sometimes be needed - they don't like it one bit and, if in a bad mood, will be hell-bent on destroying you! </p>

<p>Some submarines are fitted with the stealth device - this effectively allows them to become invisible for short periods of rime. The <b>Gatekeeper </b> (Police) and <b>Apollo </b> (Military) are invariably fitted with it. </p>

<p>In addition, as you travel deep down in the Earth's oceans, you will experience the associated weird visual affects. The consequences of this are that objects will occasionally appear to be somewhere where they are not and may sometimes completely (but only briefly) disappear. The main reason for this is the phenomenon of "light refraction". </p>

<p>When a submarine launches a torpedo at you then message <b>"TORPEDO LAUNCHED" </b> will briefly appear on the screen. Some sort of evasive action will usually be needed. </p>

<p><b>N.B.</b>  A bounty of between 1 and 4 N$ is rewarded for destroying submarines which are on the "wrong side" of the law. </p>
