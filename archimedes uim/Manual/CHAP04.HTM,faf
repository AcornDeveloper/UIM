<h2><center>Network map</center></h2>

<p>This is accessed using <b>F1</b> </p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Keys used manipulate network map</font></b> </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Left </b> and Right Cursor Keys - Move left and right along X axis<br>
<li> <b>Up </b> and Down Cursor Keys - Move up and down along Y axis <br>
<li> <b>/ </b> and <b>&pound; </b> - Move up and down along Z axis <br>
<li> <b>Ctrl-F1</b>  - Plot a course to a port<br>
<li> <b>Ctrl-F2</b>  - Distance to currently selected port<br>
<li> <b>Ctrl-F3</b>  - Next match when finding a port<br>
<li> <b>Shift-F1</b>  - Find a named port<br>
<li> <b>Shift-F2</b>  - Home to present port <br>
</ul>
<p><b>N.B.</b>  You can only use Ctrl-F1, Ctrl-F3 and Shift-F1) when you have the navigational module fitted on your central computer. </p>

<p>Each network consists of 256 ports in a rectangular formation. By using the manipulator keys for the 6 axes of travel, any port can be brought up into the viewing area denoted by a small square in the centre of the screen. In this area information can accessed about that port. </p>

<p>The number of the current network is displayed at the top and the coordinates at the bottom.</p>

<p>The coordinates are <b>X, Y</b>  and <b>Z. X </b> ranges from A-H, <b>Y </b> from 0-7 and <b>Z </b> from 0-7.</p>

<p>This can be visualised as shown</p>

<p>The network is not wrap around so to aid quick access to any port combinations of keys can be pressed to give, say diagonal tracking. Your present port can be brought into the viewing area by pressing <b>Shift-F2. </b> From your current port to the port in view the distance is calculated by pressing <b>Ctrl-F2.</b> </p>

<p>lf you have the navigation module fitted to your central computer then you may find a port and plot a course to the present port in view. However you must be in the port of call to do is. </p>

<p>To find a particular port in your present port press Shift-f0. At the prompt input the name and press <b>Return.</b>  Any combination of upper and lower case characters may be used. </p>

<p>Normal port names are between 2 and 8 characters long, however some may have a prefix such as "Bar-". In this case the length may be between 6 and 12 characters long. To avoid typing out long names all the time the wildcard '*' may be used. This stands for any number of characters. For instance typing "Bar-*" will find the first occurrence of any port with this prefix. To find the next match press <b>Ctrl-F3.</b>  </p>

<p>Plot a course by pressing <b>Ctrl-F1.</b>  The program may not plot the most direct course but will give you an optimum course. The nearest port to the central square will be taken as the desired destination. </p>

<p>This prints out on the screen the port that is closest to your destination port yet is in range of your submarine's present fuel range. You can, of course, ignore the the navigation program's advice. </p>

<p>The network map is a sophisticated navigational aid of the first order, few submarines possess One. </p>
