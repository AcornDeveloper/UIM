<h2><center>World of U.I.M </center></h2>

<p>In a time not too distant but far enough for us not to be able to reach it ourselves there is a world, this world, spinning away populated by our childrens' children. A future quite different from the one we are lead to believe will come to pass. </p>

<p>The scientists had got it wrong but then it was their turn at last. The world had heated up, of course, because of those greenhouse gases. "Too many cows breaking wind in South America" as one commentator pronounced. The general warming had shifted the world climate into a warm, damp, humid and persistent rain phase. How it rained and the humidity, enough to drive you mad or into the ocean. </p>

<p>The oceans. Tranquil, cool and inviting. Birthplace of all and now to become the new home for mankind. </p>

<p>The first people to venture there were the real pioneers going to new regions and depths never before reached. Even those robust pioneers had their limits which is why they invented the replicator to do things they could not. Just for sheer brilliance, as its name may suggest, it was able to reproduce so they only built one. </p>

<p>Trouble began to set in some time later. The Oceans had been populated by ports, autonomous cities at various depths, each with extensive facilities, all different in terms of administration and potential. </p>

<p>Those replicators had mutated as they had been made far too well. Whole communities had sprung up, machines living as if alive. Specialization was evident, evolution in action. In a typical knee-jerk reaction they were to be destroyed and in a typical shoddy way the job was botched. Evolutionary pressure had been applied and the result was "replicants" that were capable of defending themselves. </p>

<p>Now the problem was worse, much worse. They threatened to overrun everything as they reproduced. Hope was at hand. There was a solution; a U.I.M. or Ultra Intelligent Machine. Created to be almost a god. The creator was unknown. An answer to every question. A question for every answer. Power beyond compare for the beholder. </p>

<p>The quest for the U.I.M. will be long and involved, the dangers intense but the reward is priceless. You will master many skills as a trader, manufacturer, navigator, combat pilot and submariner. Many of you will not make it. Some will not even dare to try. </p>

<p>The world of U.I.M. is THE future, grasp it with both hands NOW!!</p>
