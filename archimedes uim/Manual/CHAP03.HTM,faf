<h2><center>Equipment</center></h2>

<p>This is accessed using keys <b>F3 </b> and <b>F4 </b> for the two menus. Use the cursor Up and Down keys to access an item and then <b>Return </b> to select it.</p>

<a name="L0005"></a>
<h4>Description</h4>

<p>Due to the large: number of items on offer there are two menus. The items are split roughly up into two groups, offensive and defensive. </p>

<p>Item availability varies from port to port according to the operating index. The acquisitions of a software module (e.g. mission module), a central computer, a portfolio hexagon, torpedoes, flares, sea mines and chaff do not appear on your equipment list. Their position is instead shown on the Instrument Panel (see above). In addition it is important to remember that none of the software modules will operate until you have acquired a central computer.</p>

<a name="L0006"></a>
<h4>Menu 1</h4>

<p>This first menu consists of a highly sophisticated range of combat equipment. On your travels you will encounter many aggressive and well armed opponents (see Chapter 11 ). As you progress through the 256 networks in search of your ultimate goal they will become increasingly aggressive and will have the armaments to march! <b>It is therefore essential that you both acquire and learn how and when to use what is on offer. </b> </p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Torpedo</font></b> </p>

<p>An intelligent, seek and destroy torpedo. This is initially a self-targetting torpedo taking the most threatening submarine as its target. Once a torpedo has been inserted into the launch cube it locks onto its target when in rang: and can then be manually launched. Torpedoes can only be launched against submarines. If no suitable target is present then launching is refused. </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>F8 </b> - Arm <br>
<li> <b>F9 </b> - Extract<br>
<li> <b>F10 </b> - Launch <br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Sea mines</font></b> </p>

<p>These are manually discharged devices to the stern of the submarine. They are proximity devices which activate themselves a short time after discharge. Therefore they are just as dangerous to you as your opponent. Fortunately, bunching will be refused if your velocity is too low. </p>

<ul>
<li><b> Ctrl-F7 </b> - Discharge a mine <br>
</ul>
<p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Soxel generator</font></b> </p>

<p>Your submarine is equipped with an ion formation device which operates only in sea water. It literally forms a cylinder of ions which punch holes in submarines. There is only one type of ion formation device but they have different powers with different generators. All of the generators automatically recharge after use. After a rapid volley of six shots, they soon recharge and can be fired again after just a few seconds.</p>

<ul>
<li> Keyboard - <b>F </b> <br>
<li> Joystick - Fire button<br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Phasor</font></b> </p>

<p>An extreme energy discharge device. To escape the blast you are projected a short jump into the future while all else within your area is destroyed. The time projection uses a large amount of energy so if not enough is available you are destroyed as well. </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Tab </b> - Detonate phasor device <br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Flares</font></b> </p>

<p>To divert enemy torpedoes from your submarine flares can be jettisoned from the rear. Only useful on the more primitive infra-red seeking torpedo. 'The flares decay after about 15 seconds. </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Ctrl-F9 </b> - Discharge a flare <br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Stealth device</font></b> </p>

<p>An invisibility device which causes you to drop off any opponent sonar screens giving you a chance to escape. You become both invisible to the eye and invisible to sonar. This drains your energy banks rapidly. Opponents are known to possess this technology so beware. The stealth device cannot be switched off manually, you have to wait until its internal timer switches itself off. </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Delete </b> - Engage stealth device <br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Chlorel generator</font></b> </p>

<p>The next most powerful generator. This has excellent destructive capabilities. </p>

<ul>
<li> Keyboard - F<br>
<li> Joystick- Fire button<br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">E.M.P. unit</font></b> </p>

<p>A device capable of producing an electro-magnetic pulse of such intensity that nearby electronic circuits are destroyed. It works only on submarines on the sonar and reduces the number of hits required to kill them. It will not in itself destroy a submarine though. Beware of using it too often as the energy drain can kill you. </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Ctrl-F5</b>  - Discharge a pulse <br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Manipulator arm</font></b> </p>

<p>Short range device primarily intended to samp up debris in the sea bed in the hope that something valuable might be picked up. Its main use now is to pick up cargo canisters. This can be very useful if you are low on cash as these can be sold at the next port.</p>

<p><b>N.B.</b>  They can only be picked up if there is a spare slot in the commodity manifest. </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Caps Lock</b>  - Engage manipulator arm<br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Intelligent Chaff</font></b> </p>

<p>Very high technology devices. Their effect is to confuse the enemy sonar by providing a multitude of images. Each piece of chaff contains a computer, receiver and transmitter. On receiving a sonar pulse it analyses the signal and returns a reflection corresponding to your submarine type all in 6 microseconds. Your sonar, however, is locked into phase with the chaff so that the fake signals can be filtered our. Chaff decays after about 30 seconds. </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Ctrl-F8</b>  - Discharge canister of chaff <br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Hydrox generator</font></b> </p>

<p>The penultimate generator money can buy. </p>

<ul>
<li> Keyboard - <b>F </b> <br>
<li> Joystick - Fire burton <br>
</ul>
<p>Chameleon unit</p>

<p>A most useful device. It drains little energy but its effects are to make you look like a wreck. Must be used before visual contact is made or else it is useless. Spare part for these are have to obtain so use with care. Torpedoes launched at you will fail to detonate when they collide. However they may arc round and try again. </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>C </b> - Change your sonar image <br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Goledy generator</font></b> </p>

<p>The highest power generator available. This is the ultimate submarine bourne weapon money can buy. Use with care and destruction. </p>

<ul>
<li> Keyboard - <b>F</b> <br>
<li> Joystick - Fire button <br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Thermosystem device</font></b> </p>

<p>For the bloody minded nihilistic people out there. Destroys an entire port with the touch of one button and everything else for that matter! Be careful of destroying a port you may have to visit on a mission. Can only be used when in orbit due to the extreme damage it causes.</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Ctrl-W</b>  - Destroy a port<br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Re-target system</font></b> </p>

<p>Enemy torpedoes may be re-targetted by this system so that they harmlessly explode or return to their senders. Some enemy torpedoes have non-interference circuits which cause them to explode rather than be re-targetted. Most amusing to see the reactions of enemy crews when this is used. This does not affect torpedoes launched by yourself. After use it switches itself off. </p>

<p>This is an extremely effective device and as such is a highly respected weapon. </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Copy </b> - Activate re-target system <br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Display module</font></b> </p>

<p>A multi-functional full combat use system requiring the central computer to run on. This replaces your simple sights with all the combat information you could require. Essential purchase for all submarines intending to survive any length of time out there. The information it gives you is as follows.. In the centre is a line graduated for your sights. This alters position as you climb or dive. This shows you the g-force you pull. The further away from the centre the greater the g-force. The outside vertical lines on the left show the extent to which you can cause the submarine to turn. Plus, as stated earlier, when a torpedo is armed it will automatically lock onto the most threatening submarine. The display module electronically interrogates the submarine and its status is displayed below the vertical lines on the left. The status is either blank (no target), <b>F</b> (riendly) or <b>H</b> (ostile).</p>

<h4>Menu 2</h4>

<p><b><font size="+1">Deuterium</font></b></p>

<p>A full rank of deuterium in the form of heavy water gives you a range of 1600 nautical kilometres. This is used in your onboard fusion reactor. </p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Cargo Pod</font></b></p>

<p>To increase your cargo capacity from 32 to 64 tonnes. This is a towed pod and as such is quite vulnerable. </p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Heat shield</font></b> </p>

<p>As you re-enter the earth's atmosphere on your orbital flights your heat shield becomes progressively worn away, more so if your flight path is not on target. It is essential that you check (and if necessary replace) your heat shield at every opportunity on your travels. The state of the heat shield is shown on the right of your Instrument Panel.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Fuel convertor </font></b> </p>

<p>This converts your deuterium fuel holding into energy for you to use on your submarine. In effect it increases the rate of top up of your energy banks and shields. </p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Central computer</font></b> </p>

<p>Your submarine is run by an old earth type computer reputedly once used in a nuclear power station. The central computer is the replacement for this and is <b>essential for running all software modules</b>  such as re-entry.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Teleporter</font></b> </p>

<p>This is a particle transmission system of limited range. It is only intended for difficult reentries. It should only be used if you believe that you will not survive re-entry. Long range use can sometimes result in death as the particle integrity is not maintained. Trouble with other biological material being transmitted, as well as what was intended, has in the past led to several hybrid organisms being created. They did not survive long. </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>T </b> - Teleport your submarine to the surface <br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Navigation module</font></b> </p>

<p>Some facilities of the network are only available with this software program such as course plotting. Recommended for anyone doing missions.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Portfolio hexagon</font></b> </p>

<p>Your little black hexagon which contains your share and currency holdings. It keeps them as a continuous stream of electrons in a super conducting coil. No trading is possible on the network without this hexagonal object. The hexagon can hold up to four separate share holdings and four currency holdings. </p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Re-entry module</font></b> </p>

<p>All your re-entry worries are over with this. A faultless re-entry anywhere, anytime (hopefully). </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Shift-F5</b>  - Engage/disengage re-entry module <br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Mission module</font></b> </p>

<p>In each network there is a mission to perform for various rewards. This program selects a mission for you to perform.</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Shift-F9 </b> - Select a mission<br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Financial module </font></b> 

<p>A vital piece of software to assist you in making financial decisions when trading shares and currency. See the end of Chapter 10 for more informatiom.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Ocean drive </font></b> </p>

<p>A use once only device. Enables you to transport to any port in your present network irrespective of your deuterium fuel holding. </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Ctrl-H</b>  - Engage drive<br>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="+1">Deflectors</font></b></p>

<p>A much more protective shielding system than the one you are presently equipped with. Not: for the suicidal. </p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Graviton detector</font></b></p>

<p>Enemy submarines using their stealth devices are normally invisible to your sonar. The mass of the submarine does emit gravitons which can be detected making them appear on your sonar. This is a very sensitive device and it must be treated as such. </p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Air lock</font></b> </p>

<p>Sometimes abandoned submarines are found floating in limbo. To enable you to plunder their cargo an air lock is required. Firstly attract the submarine with your manipulator arm. The air lock is automatically activated and any cargo transferred across. The abandoned submarine is then destroyed with an implosion device. Cargo will only be transferred across if there is a spare slot in the commodity manifest </p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Torpedo module</font></b> </p>

<p>This piece of software programs your onboard torpedoes so that they have the best chance possible of hitting their target. The torpedo targetting system you are initially equipped with is good but not that good.</p>

<a name="L0008"></a>
<h4>Disposing of equipment</h4>

<p>This is accessed using <b>Ctrl-F4.</b> </p>

<p>Your submarine is of limited capabilities. Only so many items may be added before certain limits are reached. Those items which are mass critical are marked on the submarine status with a tick. </p>

<p><b>Only 4 such items may be carried at any one time. </b> </p>

<p>Some missions require you to have items of equipment before it may be completed. Therefore an ability to dispose of equipment is necessary. There is little market for used equipment, so it is just dumped. Once dumped it may not be recovered so use this facility with caution. </p>

<p>Simply highlight the item to be dumped, press <b>Space </b> and it is gone. </p>

<p>Equipment may only be dumped when in a port of call as marine law forbids dumping in the ocean.</p>
